When the funds are available, the flat-roofed lean-to at the back of the building (not easily visible here behind the warden's Land Rover) will be knocked down, and an earth-sheltered extension built into the back behind. With a low-level profile, but high-efficiency insulation, solar & photo-voltaic panels on the roof, a connection to a small water turbine generator, improvements to the sewage treatment etc, it should remain a very low-impact building. Part of the idea is not to significantly change the original building's front profile, which has looked much like this for over a century. The total amount of accommodation (16 bed spaces) won't change, but the associated facilities will be extended, to include bigger/better kitchen space, a small drying room, better wash/shower rooms etc. More about this hostel and the surrounding area on the YHA's own website at http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/black-sail;top:Uplands?top:Village, Rural settlement?Youth Hostel
